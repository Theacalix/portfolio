        <p>
        The way it works is simple. Game masterâ€™s drag and drop tiles to create their map. Once finished, they switch to display mode, which opens a separate window where tiles can be revealed one by one as players explore the map.

        <h2>Knowing the Target Audience</h2>
        <p>
        In order to best understand the target audience, a survey was sent out to communities of game Masters and RPG game players to collect responses to see what features were most desired. this was collected early on in the process to inform the design of the system and plan for future added features.

              After that, the system was designed and revised multiple times, where it was presented at Creativity and Cognition 2019. The theme that year was transformational creativity. A paper describing the goals of the project in further detail is published in the <a href='https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3325480.3326548'>ACM Digital Library</a> and the project itself was demoed during the creative creativity and cognition demonstration event.

    <h2>It all starts with a logo </h2>
    <p>
    When I initially met with the heads of heritage farmed, I immediately sensed just how important their ingredients were to their brand. They listed off a flurry of gorgeous botanicals when discussing their products, and I ran with that concept to design a logo system using iconography of these same plants that star in their products.

          <p>
            Heritage Farmed is all about natural, sustainable processes, and that includes their packaging. All of their packaging was designed to be compostable and biodegradable. I researched the best materials for their needs and decided on sturdy cardboard tubes that could be used across the board with all of their products.

      <h2>The complete vision</h2>
      <p>
        To really flesh out their brand, a number of additional materials were designed to really give the complete picture of what the heritage farmed brand could look like.

      This project was designed to help people with executive functioning issues stemming from ADHD, Autism, or Anxiety/Depression achieve big and small goals. The three main features of the app are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Provide custom reminders to help users complete tasks and create routines</li>
      <li>Create projects and break tasks down to make them easier</li>
      <li>Easily track and record habits to build good routines</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>All About User Testing</h2>
    <p>
      User testing and feedback were an integral part of the design process of this project. Potential users in the target demographic were interviewed to get a sense of what they struggled with that a productivity app could help with. An initial version of the app was created for a UC Davis UI/UX class. This version was created with static screens that were mocked in illustrator, and functionality was added through inVision, creating hotspots to allow users to navigate through the mockup. User feedback was collected from 5 participants, which consisted of asking them to complete specific scenarios within the app while they were being observed. Afterward, each participant was asked open-ended questions to collect general feedback on the project.
    </p>
    <div className="flex">
      <img src = {addTask} alt ="new task screen"/>
      <img src = {addHabit} alt="new habit screen"/>
      <img src = {completeHabit} alt="check off habit screen"/>
    </div>
    <p>
      This research was used in the next iteration of the project, which continued after the UC Davis class concluded. In this phase, Emily Carlson took over the design of the look and feel of the app, while I implemented the functionality. This version was implemented as a web app, using HTML, CSS, and javascript to implement functionality and design. Steps were taken to integrate the user feedback from the previous version into this one as we worked to improve the design.
